A simple expense tracker mobile app built with Flutter, using **Google Sheets as a backend** for data storage. Track your income and expenses in real-time with spreadsheet integration.

My main aim was to explore various types of Backend integrations avaliable and for a simple use case app like an Expense Tracker this Google Sheets seemed to fit the bill pretty much as it is online(on the cloud) hence requires no local storage and easy to use.I also wanted a clean UI and as I already have made a app with pure Amoled Black UI I switched it up and went with white instead.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š Add income/expense transactions
